# AtliQ_Data-Analysis-EDA-
🚀 AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Using Python 🏨🐍📊

I analyzed AtliQ Hotels’ booking data using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib) to extract actionable business insights. (Other libraries like NumPy for numerical computations and Seaborn for advanced visualizations can also be used to enhance the analysis.)

🔹 Workflow

1. Understanding the Business Problem

Objective: Help AtliQ Hotels optimize pricing, identify seasonal demand, and improve occupancy & revenue performance.

Key questions: Which platforms generate the most revenue? What are peak/off-peak booking trends? Which cities & hotels perform best?

2. Data Collection & Understanding

Imported multiple datasets (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_bookings, fact_aggregated_bookings).

Explored structure, relationships, and key attributes (e.g., booking date, check-in, checkout, revenue realized).

3. Data Cleaning & Exploration

Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized date formats.

Conducted exploratory analysis (row counts, null checks, unique values, data distributions).

4. Data Transformation

Merged datasets into a single view for hotel performance.

Engineered KPIs such as occupancy %, revenue per room, and ADR (Average Daily Rate).

Aggregated bookings by date, hotel, city, and booking platform.

5. Insights & Storytelling

📊 Booking Trends → identified seasonal peaks and off-peak patterns.

💰 Revenue Distribution → revealed top-performing hotels & booking platforms.

🌍 Occupancy Analysis → compared utilization across hotels & cities.

🏆 City-Level Insights → highlighted high-revenue cities for business focus.

📈 This project strengthened my skills in data wrangling, EDA, visualization, and insight generation using Pandas & Matplotlib, while showing how NumPy and Seaborn could further support deeper numerical analysis and advanced visualization.
